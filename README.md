# PolyominoesGenerator

This programs generates all free polyominoes of a given surface area n.

(free polyominoes are distinct when none is a rigid transformation (translation, rotation, reflection or glide reflection) of another (pieces that can be picked up and flipped over). Translating, rotating, reflecting, or glide reflecting a free polyomino does not change its shape.)
